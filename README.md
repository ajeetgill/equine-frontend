## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [placeholder-text-for-now]().

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update your variables for supabase.

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

3. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The project should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Info related to Supabase:

- By default Supabase has "Send Confirmation Email" on signup enabled, but I disabled it for this project.
- We are also working with Supabase Storage from where the assessments get downloaded as a zip (user has to be logged in).
